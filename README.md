# Sentiment-Analysis-for-Hotels-Reviews

### About the project

The project analyzed hotel reviews to classify customer feedback as positive, negative, or neutral. The datasets were preprocessed by removing null values, tokenizing the text, eliminating stopwords, converting tokens to lowercase, and performing lemmatization. A new category column based on ratings was introduced for further analysis. 

Various machine learning algorithms were explored, including logistic regression, an ensemble model combining logistic regression, XGBoost, random forest, and a neural network. The ensemble model outperformed logistic regression alone, demonstrating the benefits of leveraging multiple models' strengths in sentiment patterns.
